# Beat-Bot

fun bot with music functionality

Built on windows 10.
Currently running on a raspberry pi.
A problem encountered when moving to the raspberry pi was running npm install to download the modules onto the pi cause the bot to no longer work.
The solution to this was that when moving the bot to include the modules. If you encounter this problem just download the modules on your machine and then move it all together to the pi.
